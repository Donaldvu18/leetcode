use link instead of a because anchor tag will reset react redux / make a request to server for page


the way browser router works is that when a user makes a request to /asdf, the server wont find the page since its a Single page app APP so it returns index.html by default which then looks at the url and returns the according page, most servers just give 404 instead of defaulting index html,

workaround is use hash router which makes every request go to # first which server then sees and returnt index html then anythin after the #/ is used to render page

mapstatetoprops is for declaring what variables/methods you want to use in that component from redux store ,doesnt matter that its on bottom
	-will be props.whatever in funct comp
	-will be tihs.props.whatever in class comp

proj workflow

2.setup page router
3. setup auth
4. setup form and fields for create stream page
5. setup api web server
6. setup all actionCreators
